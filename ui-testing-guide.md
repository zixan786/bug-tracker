# ðŸ§ª UI Testing Guide - Multi-Tenant SaaS Bug Tracker

## Testing Strategy Overview

### 1. **Manual Testing Scenarios**
- Organization creation and switching
- User roles and permissions
- Subscription limits and upgrades
- Data isolation between tenants
- Billing and payment flows

### 2. **Automated Testing**
- Component testing with Jest/React Testing Library
- E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
- API integration testing
- Multi-tenant data isolation tests

### 3. **Load Testing**
- Multiple organizations simultaneously
- Concurrent user sessions
- Database performance under load
- Subscription limit enforcement

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Organization Management
**Test Case: Create New Organization**
1. Sign up as new user
2. Create organization "Acme Corp" with slug "acme"
3. Verify organization appears in switcher
4. Check trial status and expiration date
5. Verify user is set as owner

**Test Case: Organization Switching**
1. Create second organization "Beta Inc"
2. Switch between organizations
3. Verify data isolation (different bugs/projects)
4. Check URL changes (if using subdomains)
5. Verify role changes per organization

### Scenario 2: Multi-User Testing
**Test Case: Invite Team Members**
1. As owner, invite users with different roles
2. Test role-based permissions:
   - Admin: Can manage everything
   - Member: Can create/edit bugs
   - Viewer: Read-only access
3. Verify member can't see other organizations

**Test Case: Role-Based Access**
1. Login as different role users
2. Test status dropdown permissions
3. Test assignment dropdown permissions
4. Verify admin-only features are hidden

### Scenario 3: Subscription Testing
**Test Case: Trial Limits**
1. Create organization (starts trial)
2. Add users up to plan limit
3. Try to exceed limit - should show upgrade prompt
4. Create projects/bugs up to limit
5. Test limit enforcement

**Test Case: Subscription Upgrade**
1. Click upgrade in billing dashboard
2. Select higher tier plan
3. Complete Stripe checkout (use test cards)
4. Verify limits increased
5. Test new features unlocked

### Scenario 4: Data Isolation
**Test Case: Tenant Data Separation**
1. Create bugs in Organization A
2. Switch to Organization B
3. Verify Organization A bugs not visible
4. Create bugs in Organization B
5. Switch back - verify separation maintained

## Testing Tools & Setup

### Test Data Generator
Create realistic test data for multiple organizations.

### Mock Payment Testing
Use Stripe test mode for subscription flows.

### Multi-Browser Testing
Test organization switching across different browsers.

### Performance Testing
Monitor response times with multiple tenants.

## Common Issues to Test

### Security Issues
- Cross-tenant data leakage
- Unauthorized organization access
- Role escalation attempts
- API endpoint security

### UX Issues
- Organization switching confusion
- Subscription limit messaging
- Payment flow interruptions
- Mobile responsiveness

### Performance Issues
- Slow organization switching
- Database query performance
- Memory leaks in long sessions
- Concurrent user handling

## Test Automation Examples

### Component Tests
Test organization switcher, billing dashboard, role-based UI elements.

### Integration Tests
Test API calls with organization context, subscription limit enforcement.

### E2E Tests
Full user journeys from signup to subscription upgrade.

## Monitoring & Analytics

### User Behavior Tracking
- Organization creation rates
- Feature adoption per plan
- Upgrade conversion rates
- Churn analysis

### Technical Monitoring
- API response times per tenant
- Database performance metrics
- Error rates by organization
- Resource usage patterns
